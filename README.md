This project especially i used for my exam in my college, so i submit the exam with this project.
In this app you also need some enviroment like :

1. Node JS Version >= 6
2. JDK 1.8 (Recommended)
3. Android Studio (SDK 22-26)
4. Your favorite terminal
5. React Native CLI
6. Emulator android (You can used the real device just enabled your android debugging in development mode)
7. Some coffee to make your eye on and keep spirit for that

But in this application i made, i am using api from Google maps and Zomato, so thank you so much for zomato and google map to give me free API. But so sorry for the API KEY, i cant share with u but you can request the api key from their official website :

1. Google maps (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
2. Zomato (https://developers.zomato.com/api?lang=id)

If you already have the api key, you can fill that in some module.

1. Google maps
=> Open ./android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml, replace {API_KEY_GOOGLE_MAPS} with you api key google maps
2. Zomato API
=> Open ./src/configs/config.js, replace {API_KEY_ZOMATO} with your api zomato

And to run this project you can follow some steps :

1. Open terminal
2. Enter you directory project
3. type "react-native run-android" (remember your emulator or real device already connected)
